# Welcome to the moodleLA-App

The moodleLA-App enables you to do your own learning analytics with Moodle data. It provides functions to download and pseudonymise data from Moodle logs and forums. You can also merge and pseudonymise additional data, enabling to match this data with data from your Moodle learning management system.

Begin with a project-specific configuration, as pseudonymisation is only as secure as the unique pepper for that projec

This page will contain a detailed introduction to the use of the program and the various functions. At the moment it only contains a short list of the functions.

- Course list: Retrieve a pseudonymised list of all users with the learner role in Moodle.
- Moodle Logdata: Use this function to download the log data from all users with the learner role in a Moodle course.
- Moodle Forum Data: Download and pseudonymize all forum messages from a Moodle course.
- Match & Pseudonymise Data: Upload existing data such as exam results or survey data and match the data with the users in a Moodle course.
